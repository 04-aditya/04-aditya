- 👋 Hi, I’m @04-aditya, also known as Aditya Banerjee
- 👀 I’m interested in primarily data science, but mainly I'm interested in the never-ending process of learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything around me. I would love to explore so many different technologies as and when I get the opportunity to.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that excites me!
- 📫 How to reach me, well, LinkedIn would be the fastest.
